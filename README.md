# Banks-API
REST service that can fetch bank details, using the data given in the APIâ€™s query parameters. The RESTful API is written in Django to get any branch details using ifsc code and find all the branches of a bank in a Indian city.

The API is deployed [here](https://banksapi.herokuapp.com/).<br>
1. Given a bank branch IFSC code, get branch details - [banksapi.herokuapp.com/api/banks/?ifsc=IOBA0003450](https://banksapi.herokuapp.com/api/banks/?ifsc=IOBA0003450)
2. Given a bank name and city, gets details of all branches of the bank in the city - [banksapi.herokuapp.com/api/banks/?bank=INDIAN+OVERSEAS+BANK&city=CHENNAI](https://banksapi.herokuapp.com/api/banks/?bank=INDIAN+OVERSEAS+BANK&city=CHENNAI)

## Project Setup
- Create a folder to keep env and clone of the repo.
- Navigate to the folder and setup virtual environment using <br>
```bash
  python -m virtualenv env
 ```
 - Then activate the environment using <br>
  `source env/Scripts/activate` (Use only `env/Scripts/activate` if on cmd or powershell)
- For Linux Users it will be `source env/bin/activate`
- Fork the repo and clone it in the same folder.
- Navigate to the cloned repo and the run the commands:<br>
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install
```
- This will setup the project requirements and pre-commit test hooks!
### Project Directory structure
```bash
   your-folder
   |-env
   |-credicxo
     |-requirements.txt
     |-.pre-commit-config.yaml
     |-
     |-
```
- After the above setup, run <br>
```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
```

- Start the backend server
  `python manage.py runserver`
  Runs the backend server at default port `8000`.<br />
  Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser
